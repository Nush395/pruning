# Pruning
Trying out how different pruning methods affect performance of a model trained on MNIST. The methods used are post-training weight and unit pruning.

## How to run
All the code, including dependancies are inside a single interactive notebook which can be run using Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nush395/pruning/blob/master/network_pruning.ipynb] using your own Google account.
